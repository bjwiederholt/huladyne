## Post (copy/paste ready)

Hey everyone! It's been a while since we posted here, so we figured we'd pop in with some news — we've been busy in the lab!

We just launched **CronGuard.ai**, a brand new product from Huladyne Labs. If you're a developer (or manage servers, or have ever been woken up at 3am by something breaking that shouldn't have) — this one's for you.

**What is it?**
CronGuard monitors your scheduled tasks and background jobs — the stuff that runs behind the scenes keeping your apps and systems alive. When something fails, CronGuard catches it, figures out why it broke using AI, and tells you how to fix it. No more silent failures. No more wading through logs at 2am.

**The cool stuff:**
- One line of code to set up (seriously, one curl command)
- Smart alerting that learns what "normal" looks like for your jobs — cuts alert noise by 60-80%
- AI-powered root cause diagnosis — it doesn't just tell you something broke, it tells you *why* and *how to fix it*
- Free tier available — 5 monitors, smart alerting, and AI diagnosis included

We built this because we kept running into the same problem ourselves. Cron jobs would fail silently, nobody would notice until a customer complained, and then it was a fire drill to figure out what went wrong. So we fixed it.

Check it out at **cronguard.ai** — and if you know anyone who runs scheduled jobs (so... basically every developer), feel free to share!

The hula robot is still dancing. We're still building cool things. More to come.
